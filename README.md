# BluePrint
a simple blueprint for data preprocessing


-GOAL:
Pre-modeling/modeling 80%/20% of work

Show the importance of data preprocessing, feature exploration, and feature engineering on model performace

Go over a few effective pre-modeling steps

This is only a small subset of pre-modeling
Format:



-Tutorial style:

Walk through concepts and code (and point out libraries)

Use an edited version of the 'adult' dataset (to predict income) with the objective of building a binary classification model



-Python libraries:

Numpy
Pandas
Sci-kit learn
Matplotlib

Almost entire workflow is covered by these four libraries
